 - add ores
 - add reflections to shiny / metallic blocks
 - running functionality for the character
- gombok

 immediate todolist:
  - make a stack of Screens
  - handle resizing somehow (modify UI elements? or UI elements should have dynamically calculated bounds?
  probably more expensive to recalculate everything each frame but is the most reliable)
