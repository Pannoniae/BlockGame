# BlockGame

A block game where you can do anything you want, with no one to stop you.

## What is this?

Build stuff, break stuff, explore the world. We're making a game focused on *emergent gameplay* - the kind where you have a bunch of toys to play with and discover instead of content checklist gameplay. There's a few other ones, but this one is mine.

## Why should I care?

Most block games fall into two camps:
- **Corporate slop:** Full of microtransactions, slop content and zero soul put into it
- **Your average open source voxel engine:** Endless refactoring and bikeshedding, not much gameplay and fun to be had

This one is a bit different:
- We're putting the sand back in the sandbox, not removing all the fun things!
- The world looks absolutely *inspiring* to build in, just like you used to build in 2011.
- New updates every week or so.
- We listen to feedback - suggestions actually matter lol
- Real modding - write C# code, not JSON
- It's a game made by people who like to play games, no nonsense.
