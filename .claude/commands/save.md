Save the gist of the conversation and the TODO list into a new .MD file so a sister of you can pick up the conversation exactly where you left it off.

Only save the conversation's context, no need to save general information about the repository.

ALWAYS CREATE A NEW .MD FILE, NEVER OVERWRITE. Don't try to modify this file.
